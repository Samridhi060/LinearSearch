# Linear Search Program

## Overview
The Linear Search program is a simple Java application that allows users to search for a specific element in an array using the linear search algorithm. It prompts the user to enter the size of the array, the elements of the array, and the target element to be searched. The program then returns the index of the target element if found, or a message indicating that the element is not found.

## Features
- User-friendly input prompts.
- Searches for an element in an array using linear search.
- Returns the index of the found element or indicates if the element is not present.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- A text editor or IDE to edit and run Java code.

## Conclusion
This program demonstrates the basic implementation of the linear search algorithm in Java. It is a useful tool for understanding how to search through arrays and can be extended or modified for more complex applications.
